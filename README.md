# Playlist Manager Project

## A way to organise songs

This project will be a playlist manager where users will be able to **create and delete playlists**.
Users will be able to **add and remove songs from playlists** that they create.
This project is made for anyone who enjoys listening to music and wants to organize songs they like into playlists.
This project is of interest to me because I love music and itâ€™ll be fun to create a way to manage and organize the songs I enjoy listening to.
